Hello, my name is Aoife and I am a final year Astrophysics PhD student at the University of Cambridge. The main focus of my PhD is to infer and create a database of the properties of gravitationally lensed quasars. Gravitationally lensed quasars are a by product of general relativity where a distant background object is magnified by a massive forgroud object. To create the database I have created bespoke pipelines to fit models to different types of data using MCMC methods to determine their properties.
